# Various Alpine based Docker Images

Here you'll find Docker Images mainly used on my two Banana Pis (Allwinner A20 based, armhf).
They all are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/seblucas/).
Lately I played with multi-architecture so all those images are available for the following architectures :
 * amd64
 * armhf
 * arm64

I'm using a proper manifest so you can use the main tags directly (no need for amd64-X.X.X).

If you want to learn more about multi-architecture docker images, please read [my blog](https://blog.slucas.fr/series/multi-architecture-docker-image/)
